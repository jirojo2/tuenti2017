S, C, D => numbers!

C > 4 => impossible!


1) Rectangles => 2xl1 and 2xl2 for each 4xC
2) Curves are always wellcome!
    => 1xS + 2xC == 3S (total length' -1)
    => 4xC == 2xS (total length' -1)
    => 3xC == 2S (total length -1 and length' -1)
3) D's limit a lot, not always 2xS == 1xD


3, 7, 1 => 4xC + 1xD + 2xS = 7
